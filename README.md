# DLogger
Derrick Kyle Ward's Logging Framework. This is an asynchronous logging framework. 
  * Why was this developed:
    * This was my first stab at trying to develop a useful framework/library that can be used for any application. 
  * What was Challenging:
    * Making sure all messages are guarenteed to be logged before a program, using this framework, exits.
