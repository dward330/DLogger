# DLogger
Derrick Kyle Ward's Asynchronous Logging Framework.

* **Purpose**:
  * Allows user to asynchronously Log Messages of different severity, from different threads, to a single log file. 
  
* **Why was this developed**:
  * This was my first stab at trying to develop a useful framework/library that can be used for any application. 
* **What was Challenging**:
  * Making sure all messages are guarenteed to be logged before a program, using this framework, exits.
